## Example A/B test

<div class="columns-2">
 ![](images/smartwool.png){width=95%}
 
  1. Randomly assign customers to treatments
  3. Measure response(s) 
  4. Compare groups to determine how the treatment changes response
</div>

## Why A/B tests work
By **randomizing** over a large number of customers, we create groups that are the same, on average.

</div>


Any behavioral differences between these groups is **caused by the treatments** we randomly assigned.

1, 2, 3. Repeat with me. Randomization will set you free.

## Materials
Slides and code at https://eleafeit.github.io/ab_test/.  

Public github repository with R Markdown source is at https://github.com/eleafeit/ab_test/. 


## How to use the materials

We will walk through a set of examples that I created using R. 

- **If you don't know R**, let me drive the R syntax so that you can focus on where we are going. Download the slides and follow along.
- **If you are learning R**, you should also let me drive. I can answer some R syntax questions along the way, but I don't want to get stuck in the syntatical mud. The code will be there later when you want to review.
- **If you know R well**, download the RMarkdown files and run the code as we go along.
