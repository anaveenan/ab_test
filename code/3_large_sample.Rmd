"When customers are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, and there are many customers in each group, then you may effectively have multiple experiments to analyze."

## Wine retailer experiment

![](images/wine_store.png){width=90%}

## Wine retailer experiment

**Test setting**: email to retailer customers

**Unit**: customer (email address)

**Treatments**: email version A, email version B, holdout

**Reponse**: open, click and 1-month purchase ($)

**Selection**: all active customers

**Assignment**: randomly assigned (1/3 each)


## Experiments within experiments
Consider the customers who have made a purchase in the last 60 days.  Within that subset, customers were randomly assigned to recieve email A, email B or no email. 
```{r}
d <- read.csv("test_data.csv")
hist(d$last_purch)
```


## Slicing and dicing

We can analyze the data for a subgroup as it's own test test.

```{r}
```

## Baseline variables
- days since last purchase
- website visits
- total past purchases ($)
```{r}
d <- read.csv("test_data.csv")
summary(d[,c("last_purch", "visits", "past_purch")]) 
```


## More baseline variables
- total past purchases by category ($)
```{r}
summary(d[, c("chard", "sav_blanc", "syrah", "cab")]) 
```
