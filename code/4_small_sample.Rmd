## When are sample sizes small? 
In the age of digital marketing, you'd think we would always have big samples. Not true!

Small sample tests:  
- Website test on a low-traffic page  
- Tests on B2B customers  
- Tests where the store or geography is the unit of analysis  
- When the treatment is expensive or risky  


## Wine retailer example
Suppose we want to know the effect of the email specifically for customers who have purchased more than \$1,000 in the past. 
```{r}
d <- read.csv("test_data.csv")
d_big <- d[d$past_purch > 1000, ]
aggregate(cbind(open, click, purch) ~ group, 
          data=d_big, FUN=mean)
```
There are big differences there, but are they statistically significant?

## Do emails produce higher purchases by big spenders?
```{r}
d_big$email <- d_big$group != "ctrl"
summary(lm(purch ~ email, data=d_big))
# t.test(purch ~ email, data=d_big, var.equal=TRUE) # equivalent
```
Well, they buy more, but the email effect isn't even close to significant (p=0.591).


## Do big spenders click more on email A? 
```{r}
summary(glm(email ~ group, data=d_big[d_big$group != "ctrl",]))
# prop.test(xtabs(~ group + click, data=d_big[d_big$group != "ctrl",])[2:3,2:1])
```

## Power and precision
We won't always get statistical significance when there are real effects, becasue of noise in the data. **Power** is the likelihood that we will detect a effect when it exists. It is related to of the **precision** of the estimates.

<div class="centered">
<div class="red2">
small sample sizes -> low precision and low power
</div>
</div>


##  {.flexbox .vcenter}

When you know you are facing a small sample, including baseline variable that are associated with the outcome in your analysis will increase power and precision.  

<div class="centered">
<div class="red2">
big sample -> use baseline vars to find heterogeneous treatment effects
small sample -> use baseline vars to mop up noise
</div>
</div>


## "Regression Correction"

If one of the baseline variables predicts the outcome, then including it in a regression analysis will reduce the error term.  

$y = a + b x + c  z + \varepsilon$

In a few minutes, I will tell you why you should never do this. 


## Regression correction for wine retailer
Standard analysis
```{r}
d$email <- d$group != "ctrl"
summary(lm(purch ~ email, data=d_big))$coef
```
Regression corrected
```{r}
summary(lm(purch ~ email + (last_purch < 60) + (past_purch > 50), data=d_big))$coef
```
Notice the standard error on `emailTRUE` gets a tiny bit smaller.


# Stratification

## Post-stratification
If your customers can be divided into strata that have more homogeneous treatment effects (based on a baseline variable(s)), then you can increase precision/power of your estimate of the overall average treatment effect by computing the estimate separately for each strata and then recombining. (See [Berman and Feit, 2018WP]() for an application in marketing).  

Post-stratification is achieved in a regression framework by effects coding the strata indicator (which is a categorical baseline variable) and interacting the treatment indicator with the the baseline indicator. 


## Post-stratification for the wine retailer
Setup
```{r}
d$strata <- (d$last_purch > 60)
contrasts(d$strata) <- contr.sum(2)  # effects coding
contrasts(d$strata)
summary(lm(purch ~ email*(last_purch > 60), data=d_big))$coef
```


"Regression Corrected"
```{r}
summary(lm(purch ~ email + (last_purch > 60), data=d_big))$coef
```


## Stratification and blocking
The wine experiment was completely randomized. The number of subjects who got each treatment is almost perfectly equal. This maximizes the precision.
```{r}
xtabs(~ group, data=d)
```
But we don't have perfect balance between the treatments within group. 
```{r}
xtabs(~ group + (last_purch > 60), data=d_big)
```


## Stratification and blocking

Balancing the sample in each subgroup will increase precision. This is called (not post-) **stratification** in biostats and **blocking** in engineering. This becomes more important as: 

- Sample sizes get very, very small
    - Expensive engineering tests
    - Small populations of patients 
    - Tests where stores are the unit of analysis
- The response is very noisy


# Matching
Sometimes you have a large number of baseline variables that are plausibly related to the response variable. For instance, consider a test where we on 

## Paired comparsion signficance test
When you've matched units in advance, you should analyze the test as a paired comparison test.  

`t.test(..., paired=TRUE)`
